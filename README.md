SmartDesk AI: Intelligent Ticket Classification System

An End-to-End AI + Data pipeline for automated customer support ticket analysis, sentiment classification, and business intelligence reporting. It simulates real-world ML engineering skills beyond just training models. This project demonstrates full-stack data science skills with local LLM integration.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem - 
Manual customer support ticket analysis is:

Time-consuming: Hours spent reading and categorizing tickets

Inconsistent: Human analysts may categorize tickets differently

Scalability issues: Difficult to handle large volumes of tickets

Delayed insights: Slow response to emerging issues

Technical Solution -

Built an automated AI pipeline that:

Generates realistic synthetic data using local LLMs

Automatically classifies tickets by sentiment, urgency, and category

Provides actionable insights through visualizations and reports

Runs entirely locally with no cloud costs
