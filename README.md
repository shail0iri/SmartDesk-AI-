##  Business Problem
Manual ticket analysis is:

- Time-consuming  
- Inconsistent across analysts  
- Hard to scale for large volumes  
- Slow to generate insights  

**Solution:** SmartDesk AI automates ticket processing, classification, and reporting—fully locally, no cloud costs.

# This project demonstrates:

 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

 Multi-task ML Models for Sentiment, Urgency, and Category classification

 Benchmarking across 6 ML algorithms (LogReg, Naive Bayes, RandomForest, SVM, XGBoost, CatBoost)

 Misclassification tracking for model improvement

 Interactive Flask Dashboard for visualization

 Dockerized Deployment on Render Cloud

#  End-to-End Architecture

This diagram illustrates the full flow of the project:

Ticket Generation → Simulated customer support tickets.

AI Analysis → Sentiment, urgency, and category classification.

Data Processing → Cleaning and structuring via Pandas.

Modeling → Using Ollama + DeepSeek R1 8B for intelligent analysis.

Visualization → Insights generated with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Business Insights → Decision Making → Actionable outcomes for support teams.
